# OpenChem-Implementation-for-Prediction-Solubility
The code repository contains experimentation on the OpenChem Framework to predict solubilities of small molecules in organic solvents
The example config folder has code that was used for predicting solubility of organic solvents such as Benzene, Acetone and Ethanol. The same can be used in conjuction with the main OpenChem framework hosted here - https://github.com/Mariewelt/OpenChem
The dataset used in this experimentation is available at - https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3686212
Also the results of the experiment are available in this repository. Please check the file Experimentation Results.
